This is an update to my OG Instagram Clone [Blocstagram](https://github.com/duliodenis/Blocstagram) written in Objective-C 2 years ago.

The HUD used is [ProgressHUD](https://github.com/relatedcode/ProgressHUD) and the asynchronous image downloader with cache support library used is [SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage).
